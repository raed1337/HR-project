This folder contains everything that is needed for tuning the chatbot's behavior.<br>
__For a more detailed description, please read the maual__

- The ___decision_tree___ directory contains the configuration details for making a decision process.
- The ___problems___ directory contains the configuration files for conversations. If you want to modify a conversation's flow or add new ones, you can do so here.
- The ___test_dialogues___ directory contains the test scenarios for testing the agent. If you want to debug the agent but don't want to go through typing, you can add a scenario here.
- The ___`dialogues.json`___ file contains all the questions that the agent can ask. If you want to modify a question's text, the conditions that a question must have, or add new questions, that is the file you should go to.

Now if it's your first time going through all this, you might find a little bit confusing. I feel you brother or sister or whatever it is you identify as. However, I've tried to make everything as clear as possible. But as it is with all of Man's creation, it is not perfect.<br>
At the very root of this chatbot you can find `The Hichhikers Guide of Hermes.pdf` and in it, I've gone through everything and anything.

If still, something is not clear for you AFTER you've gone through the pdf file, read the documentation AND doing a trace run, hit me up at `a.majdinasab@hotmail.com`.
