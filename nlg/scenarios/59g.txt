Hi Pam, Charlie, a computer engineer, has been performance impaired since she was hired a little over a year ago. Charlie is showing a lot of carelessness in her work, in addition to demonstrating insufficient skills. I have given her a written warning to correct her behavior, as I cannot tolerate such behavior that has incidents on the production and work of her colleagues. 
 
However, we gave Charlie the necessary training and tools. We have suggested an action plan to improve her performance, but she doesn't want to know.
