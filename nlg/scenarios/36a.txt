Hi Pam, yesterday, Celine, a mechanic in the plant with 35 months of service, was scheduled to perform maintenance and repair tasks assigned to her by her manager during the night shift. The next day, the manager found that Celine did not do any of the assigned tasks.  
 
For some time, we have observed that Celine has not been following her supervisor's instructions. I have given her several verbal warnings. 
 
Celine has mentioned that the workload does not allow her to complete maintenance and repair tasks. We believe that she is being deliberately negligent. Can I fire her?
