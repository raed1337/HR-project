Hi Pam, Alicia, a senior factory worker, was insubordinate in the afternoon.  
 
Unfortunately, this is not the first time she has acted this way, as last Friday she refused to supervise her team while her manager was in a meeting with management despite her manager's request. We gave her a verbal warning.  
 
I ask how I can correct her behavior, because Alicia is performing well, but her attitude and arrogance are not correct.
