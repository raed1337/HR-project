Hi Pam, I am exasperated because I want to fire Marc immediately. A few minutes ago, he insulted a customer in front of several witnesses. This is not Marc's first offense; he has an extensive disciplinary record, the last of which was a short two-day suspension. 
 
Marc has less than 8 months of service, so I assume that it would be "easy" to fire him for his misconduct.
