Hi Pam, I would like to dismiss Pierre, a functional analyst with 20 months of service, as he spends his days insulting and making inappropriate comments towards his colleagues.
Yet I gave him a verbal notice two weeks ago to stop his inappropriate behavior.
I did not do a formal investigation since his colleagues have just written and filed a formal complaint against him. We are wondering if we can fire Pierre.
