Hi Pam, I want to fire Peter, a functional analyst, because he insulted and attempted to humiliate his supervisor in front of the entire team because he learned that some of his favorite tasks were going to be redistributed across the team. He refuses to acknowledge that he was misbehaving and blames his supervisor's attitude towards him. We would like to fire him, as we have already given him two warnings this month.
