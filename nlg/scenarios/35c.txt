Hi Pam, I want to fire Julian, a senior day labourer, who refused to supervise the work of his department colleagues, even though his manager had asked him to.  
 
Since he was hired 16 months ago, Julian has repeatedly been insubordinate to his manager. We have given him verbal warnings and suspensions, but he refuses to correct his behavior and attitude. I see no other choice but to fire him, as his stubbornness affects the team's performance.
