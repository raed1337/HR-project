Hi Pam, Angela, a certified accountant has been underperforming for some time. The position has not been posted. She was hired based on a recommendation from a company vice president. 
 
Angela told me she had enough experience for the job, so she didn't need me to take the time to train her. During her probationary period, her performance was fine, but after a while her performance dropped significantly. So much so that it had an impact on the work of the accounting and finance team. 
 
I did not have enough time to support Angela in improving her performance. I would like to make an action plan, but I don't know how to do it.
