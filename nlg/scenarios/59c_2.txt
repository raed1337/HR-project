Hi Pam, Sophie who has been having performance issues since she was promoted to Senior IT Engineer; this even though we had informed her in writing that her performance was not satisfactory and that this was having significant incidents on the production of deliverables. 
 
Sophie stated that the lack of training, follow-up and coaching explained her problems in providing deliverables on time. 
 
We discussed ways to improve Sophie's performance. To improve the situation, we worked on a recovery plan that contained reasonable, measurable objectives, a reasonable time frame to achieve the results and the ultimate consequence if she did not meet the targets, i.e., termination.
