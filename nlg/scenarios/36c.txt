Hi Pam, I want to terminate the employment of James, a mechanic, because he has deliberately not completed the required tasks.  
 
The incident could have caused major mechanical breakdowns in the production line. He blamed his supervisor's distribution of tasks. We believe he was deliberately trying to enrage his supervisor.  
 
I would like to fire him, as he has a poor performance record and a heavy disciplinary record.
