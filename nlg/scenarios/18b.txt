Hi Pam, Maxime, a bookkeeper, wrote and filed a written complaint this morning about CÃ©line, a 13 month of service as a bookkeeper, who would not stop making fun of Maxime. She has a disrespectful attitude towards him.  
 
However, Celine does not have a disciplinary record. Yet we have shared and distributed a policy regarding disrespect and harassment in the workplace.  
 
Pending the outcome of our investigation, we moved Maxime to another department as soon as we received the complaint, which was two hours ago.  
 
We have not yet met with the key witnesses to the situation, their colleagues, as we have just begun our investigation. We don't want to fire Celine because she is performing well. However, if the allegations prove to be true, we would like her to correct her behavior. How do I do my investigation Pam?
