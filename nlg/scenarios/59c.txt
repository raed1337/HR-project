Hi Pam, Julie, who has been with us for 35 months, has been performing poorly since she was promoted to a new Intermediate Data Analyst position 6 months ago.  
 
Yet we provided her with training, coaching and tools she needed to make the transition a success. 
 
Because her performance issues are having a significant impact on production and the work of her colleagues, and because she will not accept a change in position, we would like to terminate Julie. Can I fire her?
