Hi Pam, for some time now, we have observed that Alec, a plumber with 13 months of service, is not following his supervisor's instructions. Yet the instructions were very clear. Alec was to perform the maintenance and repair tasks requested.  
 
I think that Maxime is being insubordinate because he doesn't want to put in much effort and he has a negative opinion of his supervisor.  
 
How can I correct the situation since I have already given a written warning, last Friday, 3 days ago?
