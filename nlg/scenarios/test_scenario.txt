Hi, Pam, I have Jonathan who once again was absent from work without permission.
Actually, he was absent without authorizations two weeks ago.
I think he doesn’t like evening shifts. He didn’t even notify me or his direct supervisor neither give us a valid reason. 
I had to find someone to take over quickly. 
The job of his colleagues depends on him. So his colleagues were not at all happy with the situation especially that they had to cover him in his absence. 
In addition, the workload is already at its peak since we are in the high season. I want to fire him. This is not his first time causing us such troubles!!!
