Hi Pam, I would like to know if I can fire Alexander, a marketing specialist with 35 months of service. 
 
Alexander does not miss an opportunity to insult and disrespect his colleagues even though I gave him a verbal warning 10 days ago for his disrespect towards his colleagues. 
 
I am not sure if I can fire Alexandre, because I have not yet done a formal investigation and his disciplinary file is not loaded. Can I still fire him?
