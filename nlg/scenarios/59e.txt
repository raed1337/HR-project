Hi Pam, Joseph Blanchette, an insurance broker for large clients, is not meeting his monthly targets. This problem has persisted since he was hired a little over 6 months ago. She was hired because of her excellent performance at her previous employer.  
 
I know that Joseph needs time to adapt to his new reality. However, he needs to improve his performance quickly, because he is causing me to lose significant income. How can I correct the situation?
