Hi Pam, I am exasperated because I want to immediately fire Marc who yesterday, despite my multiple verbal warnings, disrespected a regular customer in our warehouse. 
 
He understands there is zero tolerance for rudeness to customers. 
 
However, Marc has more than 36 months of service, so it will be more difficult to fire him since he does not have a very loaded disciplinary record.
