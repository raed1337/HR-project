Hi Pam, this afternoon, Amélie refused to follow her supervisor's instructions.   
 
Indeed, Amélie refused to carry out her immediate supervisor's request to supervise the work of her colleagues in the department, even though her manager had asked her to do so.  
 
There is no one to supervise the quality of the team's work when the employee in charge of the team refuses to perform her duties! 
 
I would like to fire Amélie because her behavior and performance have deteriorated a lot lately. However, I don't think it would be easy to fire her because she has 35 months of service, as she has no disciplinary record.
