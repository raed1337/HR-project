hi pam i have an employee who once again was absent from work without permission i would like to fire him because he is absent too frequently
samuel is aware that he cannot be absent from work when he wishes
the employee is 24 years old
he always has questionable explanations to explain his absences he suggested that the weekly work schedule did not leave enough days off
okay i think he s not happy with the way the weekly schedules are done but there is not much i can do since we operate according to seniority

i don t see what i can do all the other young employees are adjusting well to their schedule
i have already given two written warnings
samuel has been working in our office for almost a year and a half
i would like to fire the employee because he does not recognize that he needs to change his behaviour

Yes The employee knows very well that he cannot be absent from work without a valid reason or without the authorization of human resources
The employee is 24 years old
He said he was entitled to his day off which is not true I never gave him permission
No I do not think so I think he wanted to have a long weekend since he had rented a cabin
Not to my knowledge
I had offered him a day off next week He refused because he had already made his reservation for the chalet
Yes I previously gave two warnings for his unauthorized absences
He has been working for the factory for 5 months
I would like to fire the employee
I would like to know how I should fire the employee

Hi Pam I have an employee who didn t show up at the office this morning He did not notify his manager or human resources
We have clearly informed him that he must justify his absences with his superior or human resources
the employee is 24 years old
The employee has not provided an explanation at this time He hasn t contacted us
I do not know
I know he has a child who has been sick for a week but that does not justify his unauthorized absence
I do not know what support offered since the employee did not notify us
He was given verbal notice two weeks ago for an unjustified absence
The employee has worked for us for 18 months
I would just like to correct the situation I don t know what to do exactly
I would just like to know how to correct the situation
Hi Pam I have a production employee who is absence today
Yes He knows that he must inform human resources or his manager before be absence from work
the employee is 24 years old
Apparently the employee would have informed his manager the day before that he was beside his dying grandfather in the hospital and that he therefore wanted a day off However the manager informed him that he should have communicated in advance because it is difficult to find an employee available for weekend schedules
I do not think so I just think he was negligent in not informing us beforehand of his intention to be away from work
I think he is shocked by the imminent death of his sick grandfather
I don t see what we could have done He informed us at the last minute that he was to be at his sick father s bedside last Saturday
No Usually it is an employee who is professional and responsible
The employee has worked for the plant for 29 months
I just want to correct this situation
How do I handle the unauthorized absence of an employee that is potentially due to death of a loved one
Hi Pam I have a production employee who is absence today
Yes He knows that he must have authorization from human resources or his manager before taking time off for weekend shifts
the employee is 24 years old
The employee reportedly went to his dying mother s bedside in the hospital He would have communicated to his manager a few minutes before the start of his shift of his intention to be absent from the shift We understand the situation but we cannot tolerate such behavior He should have informed us a few days in advance
I do not think so I just think he was remiss in not giving us advance notice of his intention to be away
I think he is shaken by the inevitable death of his mother who was very ill
I don t see what we could have done He informed us at the last minute that he was to be at his sick mother s bedside last Saturday
I already gave him a warning for an unjustified absence a month ago
The employee has worked for the factory for 15 months
I just want to correct this situation
How do I handle the unauthorized absence of an employee that is potentially due to death of a loved one
Hi PAM I have an employee who did not show up to the office today She was not allowed to be absent
Yes She knows the office policy
the employee is 24 years old
When she called us she said she had no choice but to stay home to look after her daughter since the daycare is closed on Thanksgiving Day However she knows very well that call centre employees cannot be absent on thanksgiving without prior authorization
I think she does not like the policy of compulsory labour for employees with the least seniority on holiday
She said she had a hard time finding someone to babysit her daughter on Thanksgiving Day
I couldn t do much In any case many employees find themselves in this situation
I gave a warning for similar reasons a few weeks ago
The employee has worked for us for about 10 months
I would just like to correct the situation
I want to know how I can sanction the employee s behaviour
I have a production employee who showed up late to his workstation during the employee rotation for the night shift
Yes I have informed the employee of the attendance policy
the employee is 24 years old
He said his vehicle was stuck in the snow It didn t seem like a valid excuse to me
I could understand that he doesn t like working at night There is nothing I can do because we operate according to seniority
Not to my knowledge
I told him he has to learn to adjust to his night shift if he wants to continue working for us
I just told her verbally to show up for work on time
The employee has been working for 5 months
Yes PAM I would like to address the situation
No thanks
Hi Pam Paul has been away from work since the day before yesterday As we  not heard from him since Monday we believe he left the company voluntarily thus abandoning his position
Paul knows the policy regarding absence from work

We do not yet have a formal policy of absences We are a young business

Paul has been working for the factory for 20 months
What should I do in a case of job abandonment
